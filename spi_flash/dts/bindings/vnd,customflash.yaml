  QSPI NOR flash supporting the JEDEC CFI interface.

compatible: "senselab,qspinand"

include: [base.yaml, "jedec,spi-nor-common.yaml"]

on-bus: qspi

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  jedec-id:
    required: true

  size:
    type: int
    description: |
      The size in bits. Set this or size-in-bytes, but not both.

  size-in-bytes:
    type: int
    description: |
      The size in bytes. Set this or size, but not both.

  # Match original driver NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_QE_BIT Kconfig default.
  quad-enable-requirements:
    default: "S1B6"

  

  address-size-32:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate that 32-bit addressing is to be used.
      If not specified 24-bit addressing will be used.

  ppsize-512:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate that the write opcode operates on 512-byte pages.
      If not specified the write opcode operates on 256-byte pages.

  sck-delay:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of clock cycles CSn must be asserted before it can go low
      again, specified in nanoseconds.

  rx-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of clock cycles from the rising edge of the SPI clock
      until the input serial data is sampled.

  cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate phase starts with asserted half-phase (CPHA=1).
      For this driver using this property requires also using cpol.

  cpol:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate clock leading edge is falling (CPOL=1).
      For this driver using this property requires also using cpha.

  sck-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum clock speed supported by the device, in Hz.
